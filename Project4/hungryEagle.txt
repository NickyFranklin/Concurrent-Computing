Hungry Eagles Problem
m Feeding Pots
n Baby Eagles
t number of feedings
0 < m <= n
m eagles can eat at any given point

Feeding pots are empty at beginning and mother is sleeping

After a baby eagle feeds, the pot is empty

If there are no feeding pots, the first baby eagle must wake the mother up
The mother will then hunt and fill all the feeding pots

Only one baby eagle can wake the mother

If all filled pots are being eaten and the rest are empty, the babies wait to wake mother

After the t-th cycle, they get fucking yeeted

Semaphores Needed:
babySem
mutex
potsEmpty
momSem
momBack
Mutex2

ready_to_eat()
	wait Mutex
	if(food available)
		food--
		if(food == 0)
			food available = no
		numberEating++;
		signal mutex
	else
		wait potsEmpty
		wait momSleeping
		signal mom
		wait momBack
		food available = yes
		food--
		signal mutex
	return
	
finish_eating()
	wait Mutex2
	if(number eating > 1)
		number eating--
		signal mutex 2
	else
		number eating--
		signal potsEmpty
		signal mutex2
		
goto_sleep()
	signal momSleeping
	wait mom
	retire()
	if(isRetired == true)
		gameOver

food_ready()
	food = m
	signal momBack
